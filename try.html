        <h3>1. By Anusha Jindal</h3> 
       <p>I was forced into watching Mockingjay: Part II this weekend. To clarify, I watched the second part of the last Hunger Games movie without having read any of the books, without having watched any of the movies.
        Needless to say, I was confused as fuck.So many questions and thoughts ran through my mind as I watched the movie. Why is Peeta so thin? Did that huge-ass bruise really disappear from her neck the next day? 
        Is Katniss supposed to look like she's about to burst into tears at any given moment, or is that just Jennifer Lawrence? Woody Harrelson is in this movie? Hey, it's Margaery from Game of Thrones! Who's President Snow? What's a Mockingjay? Lesser Hemsworth is pretty hot.
        Well, you get the point. I know how the book ended and I still have no idea who anyone is, and neither do I know their names, with the exception of Peeta, Gale, President Snow, that Coin woman, and Katniss. 
        Of course, knowing how the book ended means I probably should read the first book, so here I am, the last person on earth to read The Hunger Games.
        And it was good. It was really good. My sister was right (she usually is).</p>
        <h3>2. By Aalishna Taneja</h3>
        <p>A lot of things are troubling me about The Hunger Games. A lot of things which I more and more perceive and which are not solely connected with this book but with the metaphor behind the words. 
        People attach themselves to fictional freedom without seeing what really something is and which unfortunately is here to stay because you can't wake a person who is pretending to be asleep. You can’t make a shift on a deeper level, 
        if the only thing that attracts you to this book is – a vision of fight, retaliation and the outcome of freedom.
        Freedom of flesh.In comparison to the freedom of and from your mind which is nowhere to be found.
        And this is why I detest this book, although detest is such a strong from the ego word. 
        Because the whole purpose of this story is to show how people shouldn’t sacrifice their
         children for the better of their communities and with the positive outcomes realise that 
        we are so much stronger and yada yada.</p>

        <h3>1. By Anusha Jindal</h3> 
       <p>I found a lot of this book incredibly tedious. I tend to avoid the winners of the Man / Booker – they make me a little depressed. The only Carey I haven’t liked won the Booker (Oscar and Lucinda), I really didn’t like the little bit of Vernon God Little I read and I never finished The Sea despite really liking Banville’s writing. 
        So, being told a book is a winner of the Booker tends to be a mark against it from the start, unfortunately.
        I’m going to have to assume you have read this book, as if I don’t I won’t be able to say anything about it at all.
         Apparently, when Yann Martel wrote this he was feeling a bit down and this was his way of plucking himself up. Well, good on him. 
         That’s just great. I was a little annoyed when I found out that the person the book is dedicated to had also written a story about a man in a boat with a wild cat and had considered suing for plagiarism.</p>
        <h3>2. By Aalishna Taneja</h3>
        <p>It's not that it was bad, it's just that I wish the tiger had eaten him so the story wouldn't exist.
           I read half of it, and felt really impatient the whole time, skipping whole pages, and then I realized that I didn't have to keep going, which is as spiritual a moment as I could hope to get from this book.</p>
        <h2> 2. Harry Potter and The Philospher's Stone</h2>
        <img src = "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1598823299i/42844155.jpg" height = "200 px" width = "150px" alt="image">

        <h3>1. By Anusha Jindal</h3> 
       <p>Both of my kids were born after the whole Harry Potter series was released. They are now old enough to start appreciating the story so I thought it would be fun to read it out loud to them. While it did take us a while because, you know . . . life happens . . . we were able to find a few minutes every few nights or so to read a chapter or part of a chapter. It was really fun to see them getting into it.

        They are looking forward to watching the movie and starting in on the Chamber of Secrets!.</p>
        <h3>2. By Aalishna Taneja</h3>
        <p>I'm going to keep this brief since there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. clears throat
            I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn't imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry. I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.
            I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.
            It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting.
            And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What's not to love?</p>
